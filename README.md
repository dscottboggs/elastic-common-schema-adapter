# Elastic Common Schema Adapter

Automatically generated Crystal types matching the Elastic Common Schema. This
library is intended to support a formatter for logging in Crystal, but because
it is automatically generated from the ecs definition document, it doesn't do
anything except store those generated types.

   dependencies:
     ecs:
       github: dscottboggs/ecs
